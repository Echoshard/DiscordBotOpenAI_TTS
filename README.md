# OpenAI TTS DiscordBot
This is a simple discord bot that can produces mp3's using Open AI's TTS API. 



### Setup:
Replace  the DISCORD_TOKEN and the OPENAI_KEY key with your keys.

> Make sure your discord bot has permissions to attach files.

then run the bot!

### How to Use:
Type to the Discord bot in a DM. It will attach an Mp3 of that text in the voice currently selected. It defaults to echo as the starter voice. I use this to create quick MP3's for games or promos

### Voice Changing
You can change the voice anytime by typing `VOICE` in all caps followed by the change you want to make. Example: `VOICE alloy` choices are echo, fable, onyx, nova, or shimmer. you can find more info about it here https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech
